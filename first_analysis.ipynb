    "# First analysis\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to look at data from individual plays and from individual players from 2009 to present using data from [nfldb](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb), with the goal of estimating fantasy football scores from the features in the available data.  In particular, we want to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How accurately can we predict fantasy football scores for a given set of scoring rules?\n",
    "- For a given fantasy football contest, can we estimate the distribution of scores for all players well?\n",
    "- What is the expected value of a bet using an optimized machine learning algorthim using this data?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will proceed as follows: the data is in a PostgreSQL database with 8 separate tables, with the full schema found in pdf form [here](http://burntsushi.net/stuff/nfldb/nfldb.pdf).  We will use this to write an SQL query to obtain statistics for players in positions relevant to fantasy football, including their own average stats over the previous several games, average stats for their team, and average stats for the opposing team.  To make things concrete we will be using [Fanduel's scoring and lineup rules](https://www.fanduel.com/rulesandscoring) which will require one quarterback, two running backs, three wide receivers, one tight end, one kicker, and one team defense.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL query will be used to populate two pandas `DataFrame` objects (one for all offensive players, one for team defenses since the nature of the features will not be similar between those two cases).  From there we will use scikit-learn to perform feature selection and/or dimensionality reduction on the data and train (and cross validate) models for each position.  Since we have no real reason to care about the effect of individual features on the model (*i.e.* determining model coefficients), we are free to transform the data as we please and use whatever model has the best overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the ultimate goal is to see if our gambling machine can expect to win money over the course of many bets, on top of estimating the score of our own optimal lineup, it would be useful to obtain an estimated distribution of opponent scores as well.  One way to do this is by looking at results from given contests and obtaining information about the scores of the entrants.  If it is possible to obtain the scores for all participants (which appears to be possible, but perhaps not easy at first glance), then we can simply apply the Bootstrap to estimate quantities of interest.  If not, another option would be to use a parametric distribution as an approximation (*e.g.* a normal distribution). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements for a winning predictor\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project we are able to make some statements about what level of performance is required for an algorithm to actual win money over a large number of competition entries.  Let's take a simple example of a fantasy football contest where a \\$1 bet will return \\$1.80 (*i.e.* an 80 cent net) for a result in the top half of scores and nothing for a result in the lower half.  If we use $X$ as the random variable giving the winnings of a random contest entry the expectation $\\mathbb{E}[X] = (1.8 - 1)/2 = .4$, so that a typical entrant will have to lose \\$6 in order to win \\$4. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the output of our algorithm $Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, for a win in a contest we require \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "P(Y > \\mu_0) &= P\\left(Z > \\frac{\\mu_0 - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) \n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where Z is a standard normal variable and $\\mu_0$ is the median score in the contest, which is also the mean score if the scores are normally distributed.  "
